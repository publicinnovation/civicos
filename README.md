CivicOS: a civic operating system for citizens
=======

This repo is a front-end static prototype of what may eventually become a civic operating system. At its core, CivicOS is a community information tool that is centered around the needs of citizens rather than the structure of government.

There are be several modular components to CivicOS, the first of which is CITX (citizen + experience).

## CITX
CITX provides a user journey targeted primarily at engaged citizens seeking more information about what's happening in their communities and in the region as a whole. The user journey is guided by six fundamental questions that move citizens from information to action:

1. How are we doing?
2. Who's responsible?
3. How much money are we spending?
4. Where's the money coming from?
5. What are some current issues?
6. How can I get involved?

## Roadmap
Public Innovation will pilot CivicOS in the Sacramento region during Summer 2014. While there are other components to CivicOS that will be added in the future, their implementation will depend on our monetization strategy.
